                                  <p>Shigeru Miyamoto stated that Nintendo had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since the first release of Super Mario Bros.; however, it was not possible because of the limitations of the NES. The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back further, to the green dragon Tamagon in the 1984 video game Devil World: both are green lizards that hatch from eggs and can eat enemies with their large mouth, and also emit the same noise when they hatch. </p>
                                   <p>Once the more powerful Super NES was released, Miyamoto was finally able to implement Yoshi into the series, putting Yoshi into the video game Super Mario World. Yoshi proved to be popular in this debut, which caused the next game in the series, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, to focus on the Yoshi species. </p>

                      <p>Due the bigger power of Super Nitendo, Shigeru Miyamoto was able to add in Super Mario World much more enemies and obstacles as new maps. This feature made possible the creation of secret maps, where usually Mario was direct to a different purpose than save the Princess Peach. Those minor objectives include take marshmallows, flows, get more lives and start a challenge game </p>
                      <p>Each level that is red has, at least, two ways to accomplish. The first aim directs Mario to save Princess, as the other level directs Mario to a challenge map called Star Road. In this map the main is not find princess, but just pass the hard level until the end, where appears a mensage "You Are the Best Player". After this, all scheme of colors from game is changed, as the enemies has different aspect. </p>
