                      <p>In Super Mario 64 a giant Chain Chomp (also known as the Big Chomp) is found in Bob-omb Battlefield (where a sign mentioning it hyphenates its name as "Chain-Chomp"), guarding a jail cell containing the Power Star involved in the mission Behind Chain Chomp's Gate. It is attached to a wooden peg, and lunges at the player if they get too close. He will cause Mario to lose three health points if he runs into it.</p>
                      <p>Each level that is red has, at least, two ways to accomplish. The first aim directs Mario to save Princess, as the other level directs Mario to a challenge map called Star Road. In this map the main is not find princess, but just pass the hard level until the end, where appears a mensage "You Are the Best Player". After this, all scheme of colors from game is changed, as the enemies has different aspect. </p>

                      <p>To progress, the player must collect Power Stars by completing a variety of missions, ranging from tasks such as defeating a specific enemy, completing a puzzle, collecting a set amount of items, or besting a NPC in a friendly competition. There are a total of 120 Power Stars in the game, though only 70 need to be collected in order to complete the game. The Power Stars are split between the fifteen main courses, nine secret courses, and other objectives. </p>
                      <p> The main courses contain six numbered missions each plus a hidden Power Star for collecting 100 coins. Though missions for a level are numbered, most missions can be performed out of order. Other missions, however, can only be completed by selecting a specific scenario from the course selection screen, as to prompt the appearance or disappearance of a character or object needed to complete the task. </p>
